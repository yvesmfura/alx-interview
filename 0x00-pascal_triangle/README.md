# Pascal's Triangle Generator

## Overview
This project focuses on generating Pascal's Triangle using Python. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical structure that starts with a 1 at the top, and each subsequent row is constructed by summing adjacent elements from the row above.

### Prerequisites
Before diving into this project, ensure you are familiar with the following Python concepts:
- **Lists and List Comprehensions:** Create, access, modify, and iterate over lists. Utilize list comprehensions for concise code, especially when generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Functions:** Define and call functions, handle parameters and return values. You'll be returning a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Loops:** Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate through sequences. Nested loops are essential for generating each row of Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Conditional Statements:** Implement logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., edges always being 1).
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition, crucial for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Indexing and Slicing:** Access elements and slices of lists to identify and sum correct elements when constructing each row.
- **Memory Management:** Understand list storage and copying, especially when creating new rows based on previous values.
- **Error Handling (Optional):** Use try-except blocks to manage potential errors, though this is not mandatory for this project.
- **Efficiency and Optimization:** Consider time and space complexity when implementing Pascal’s Triangle. Optimize your solution for better performance.
